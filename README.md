# SmartWater-Libelium-Station
I collected data from a Libelium Station with a temperature sensor(battery level, temperature data) and visualized it in Grafana. 


	I downloaded Waspmote Pro Ide, which I used to connect the SmartWater Libelium Station, which has a temperature sensor, to the internet. After that, I also transferred the collected temperature data from the Libelium station to the Meshlium Gateway. I then used Grafana to visualize this data in this graph.
